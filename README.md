# Chunks-8

Chunks-8 is a custom-built 8-bit computer system—from scratch.

Designed as a full-stack learning and portfolio project, it includes architecture design, a C++ cycle-accurate emulator, a custom assembler, and eventually a Verilog FPGA implementation targeting the Arty S7.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a simple but powerful 8-bit CPU
- Write and document my own ISA
- Create a working software emulator and assembler toolchain
- Reimplement in Verilog and run real programs (e.g., Pong!)
- Showcase deep digital design, low-level programming, and system-level thinking

## 🧩 Phases

1. Architecture Design (ISA, memory, block diagram)
2. C++ Emulator (CPU core, memory, I/O)
3. Assembler & Dev Tools
4. Verilog Build on Arty S7
5. Graphics & Demo Programs (e.g., Pong, Snake)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- C++17 (simulator + assembler)
- Verilog/SystemVerilog (FPGA logic)
- Vivado + Arty S7 FPGA
- Markdown + draw.io (docs + diagrams)
